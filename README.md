# ssbg_flutter

Rewrite of [ssbg][ssbg] on Flutter.

Electron's ssbg build is huge. And when I compared them to Flutter build is like heaven and earth. Like, around ~200MB vs ~20MB. Might as well re-write it. I mean, Flutter is easy, dart is like javascript with typed function (No, not typescript. It's slow), it's like writing react-native but easier and smaller build size, and a lot less headache.
